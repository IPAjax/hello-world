# hello-world
This is how I am saying Hello World! with my GitHub account!

If you are reading this, you must be bored. I am writing this as an introduction
for myself, to GitHub. It's exciting for me to be moving forward with freelance
development career. After 10 years of developing apps plugins and patches solely
for my own company, AMW Stuidos, I am looking forward to using what I have learned
to help other small businesses!
