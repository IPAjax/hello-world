# hello-world
This is how I am saying Hello World! with my GitHub account!

If you are reading this, you must be bored. I am writing this as an introduction
for myself, to GitHub. It's exciting for me to be moving forward with a freelance
development career. After 10 years of developing apps, plugins and patches solely
for my own company, AMW Studios, I am looking forward to using what I have learned
to help other small businesses!

This paragraph was added from my Mac while I am learning to use git!
